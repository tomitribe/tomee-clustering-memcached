= TomEE Session Clustering using memcached

== Abstract

This is a simple project aiming at demonstrating how to set up HTTP Session clustering in TomEE using memcached.

== Content

The application is fairly simple and only has a simple JSP to visualise the current session ID and an easy way to add some data in there.
It all relies on the library https://github.com/magro/memcached-session-manager which has support for Tomcat 7, 8 and 9.

In order to run everything, there are 2 options
* run locally with TomEE maven plugin for testing the application
* use docker to create various containers and have a more real life deployment

The Docker images are build as part of the build, it should be all ready to run after the build.

== How to run it?

=== Locally

As said previously, the local option is primarily targeting development.
Idea is to being able to work on the application with a Mock implementation of the session manager and therefor no need to set up a memcached cluster.

It is as simple as

```
mvn clean package -DskipTests tomee:run
```

Then, you just need to open a browser to `http://localhost:8080/tomee-clustering-memcached-1.0-SNAPSHOT`

NOTE: it is possible to change the context path to something shorter.


=== Using docker

During the build process, maven is going to build all necessary docker images.
There is one for the load balancer based on Apache HTTPD.
There is another for the TomEE instances.

To make it easier to run and test, there is a docker-compose file available under `src/main/docker-compose`.
Make sure to go to that directory and run

```
docker-compose up
```

This should start 4 containers:
* 3 of type TomEE named: seattle, boston and hawaii
* and one for Apache HTTPD named lb-httpd

After everything is up and running, you can hit every TomEE instance individually.
But the goal is to use the Apache HTTPD load balancer.

So make sure to open a browser at `http://localhost:9080/tomee-clustering-memcached-1.0-SNAPSHOT`

It should pick up one of the 3 TomEE instance.
By checking the JSP data, you will know the one that server the request.

As the configuration has sticky session configured, you will always end up by going to the same backend TomEE.

Now, add a couple of entries into the map.

Then, do a docker stop on the container that was serving your request and refresh the page.
You should see the same data, but served by another backend server and therfore with a new JSessionID.

== Todo

Current setup does not seem to work properly from the Apache HTTPD point of view.
The /balancer-manager does not seem to work.

Locally with the same configuration outside Docker, it seems to work, so probably so weird issue with my Docker set up.
